### Bio 

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Institute for Bioengineering of Catalunya (IBEC)](http://www.ibecbarcelona.eu/) and the [Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST)](http://bist.eu/). I am a Lecturer in cognitive science and computational neuroscience at the [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](www.upf.edu). I hold a Ph.D. (Magna Cum Laude) in Computational Neuroscience from Universitat Pompeu Fabra, an M.Sc. in Cognitive Systems & Interactive Media and a BSc (Magna Cum Laude) in Psychology.

<!-- Before starting my path in ha academia, I've been working for several years as Business Data Analyst for the Viacom group and Mondadori group. -->


### Research 

I study the diverse ways the brain controls behavior in order to understand cognition in health and disease. I apply machine learning and data science techniques to behavioral and neural data in order to decode and predict how decisions are made. I design neural networks and control architectures to emulate biological learning principles in software and robots that adapt to the world.
